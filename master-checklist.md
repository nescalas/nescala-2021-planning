This is the top-level planning document for 2021. We should open individual Issues for the various tasks, but the idea here is to keep an eye on the overall schedule. The goal is to avoid the usual last-minute crunch, by planning for a gentler full-year cycle that gets as much as possible done well in advance of runtime.

This schedule is *not* hard-and-fast, and we'll undoubtedly slip some dates. That's fine, so long as we don't get into the habit of procrastinating about everything.

This might become a template for future years (and I'd suggest that it does so), but that's up to the organizing committee for each year.

## April - May

- [ ] Recruit initial members of the *local* team. (Goal: at least six people who are willing to consider themselves involved.)
- [ ] Begin site search. At this point, this is mostly brainstorming and opportunistic research. If we find a site we really like, though, be prepared to pounce at any time.
- [ ] Get a bank card for at least Justin, so that we can easily make purchases.

## June - August

- [ ] Begin sounding out sponsors. Not looking for any commitments yet, but touch base and start to figure out who is plausible and what the contacts are at each company.
- [ ] Keep talking up the organization locally, and look for more committee. *Ideal* size is 10-12, although that's ambitious.
- [ ] Begin monthly calls for the entire concom.
- [ ] Draft initial budget. Note that this depends *enormously* on sponsors, so create conservative, loose and mid-line versions.

## September

- [ ] Lock down site and dates. Need to coordinate with Typelevel.
- [ ] Open ticket sales. Reserve some tickets for speakers / diversity / sponsors.
- [ ] Open RFCs. (Possibly sequentially, possibly in parallel; work with Typelevel on this.)

# October

- [ ] Close RFCs.
- [ ] Start to figure out catering, parties, etc.

# November

- [ ] Announce schedule.

## December - January

- [ ] Get serious about enrolling sponsors. Try to have all sponsors lined up by early February.
- [ ] Gather sponsor logos for website and t-shirts. (Note that monochrome versions are best for t-shirts, if relevant.) Needs to be done before we order t-shirts.

## February

- [ ] Design and order t-shirts by one month out. (To avoid rush surcharges.)

## March

- [ ] Figure out printing of name badges, pronoun ribbons, etc.
- [ ] **RUNTIME**
